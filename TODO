BUG: 
 
When a keystroke is pressed, emit the new character 
SETUP ADMIN PORTAL
LOGGING STUFF ONTO THE DATABASE AND GETTING STUFF FROM THE DATABASE LAST => SOCKET IO FIRST. Set the question upon loading from MongoDB
Start doing user acceptance testing later

BUGS
Two users should not have the same name for ease of visibility

IMPROVEMENTS
Add loading screen when loading site
Create a 1 sec delay for the system to get caught up
How socketio emits information. Currently emitting the entire paragraph but should emit specific characters and index
refactoring some code to make it cleaner, commenting code

Maybe to sync up, make the new user request info from another client? Maybe first user of room?
This way things only get moved to the database at the end of the phase.
