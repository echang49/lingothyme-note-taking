BUGS
Two users should not have the same name for ease of visibility

IMPROVEMENTS
Add loading screen when loading site
How socketio emits information. Currently emitting the entire paragraph but should emit specific characters and index
refactoring some code to make it cleaner, commenting code (request-info is very nasty lol, so is phase-change)
Create more paragraphs for each paragraph component (if do this, each paragraph component starts with 1 block)
Make accessible
Make responsive
Move stuff to database semi-frequently? Like once every 30 seconds?
Make alert on create room text selectable
