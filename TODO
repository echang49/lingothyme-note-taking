DEVELOP SYSTEM WHERE STUDENTS CAN WRITE ON THE PLATFORM AND THEN DOWNLOAD IT

Create room codes and then allow students to make Websocket
Take from last year websocket project but adapt it to my needs.
Create two different codes. One for the normal user priveleges EX: CODE - ABCDE and one for admin user priveleges EX: ABCDE-1A4G4
When someone joins a room, it will first pull everything from the database
When a note is updated, send to everyone on websocket and send to the database as well
When the admin says that the room is done, a pdf will be made of the contents and sent to the admin
Allow admin to create room

FRONTEND

Admin Room Create Page
Admin Room View
User Room View

BACKEND
    Access Code Page
        If access code exists, bring to room. If not, give warning
    Admin Room Create Page
        Allow user to add question/note on top left
        Allow user to set participant numbers
        User must send their email
        Allow user to choose the flow of events (currently will only be brainstorm, paragraph writing)
        Set date of discussion (Room will expire the day after if not used. Cannot set rooms after 1 month of today)
        After, give public code and admin code
    Admin Room View
        Allow admin to have all permissions of the user
        Allow admin to change event stage (Brainstorm to Paragraph Writing to End)
        On end, the information in the database is packaged as a PDF and sent to admin user email

DATABASE 
    On saving something, it is sent to database?
    People can only edit their own stuff. 

MISC
    Make perpetual license contract with shubham. Shubham can use his code freely, can't use it to build a competing product. Can have copy of the project codebase for personal reasons.

FUTURE:
    Make Responsive
    Allow viewers to join with a /view/VIEWCODE where code might be ABCDE and VIEWCODE might be EDCBA

DONE:
Create Access Code Page
Create Admin Login USERNAME: LingoThyme PASSWORD: IrisNanEdward (Basic security for now since we'll open it up later)
