Start doing user acceptance testing later
When room is done, delete from MongoDB once the email with notes has been sent
Implement hard cap. If someone joins a full room, tell them taht and bring them back to home page.

BUGS
Two users should not have the same name for ease of visibility

IMPROVEMENTS
Add loading screen when loading site
How socketio emits information. Currently emitting the entire paragraph but should emit specific characters and index
refactoring some code to make it cleaner, commenting code (request-info is very nasty lol, so is phase-change)
Create more paragraphs for each paragraph component (if do this, each paragraph component starts with 1 block)
Make accessible
Make responsive
Change Phase dynamically based on array from MongoDB
Update database every minute there's a change?

Maybe to sync up, make the new user request info from another client? Maybe first user of room?
This way things only get moved to the database at the end of the phase.
