Two users should not have the same name for ease of visibility

IMPROVEMENTS
Add loading screen when loading site
How socketio emits information. Currently emitting the entire paragraph but should emit specific characters and index
Create more paragraphs for each paragraph component (if do this, each paragraph component starts with 1 block)
Make responsive
Move stuff to database semi-frequently? Like once every 30 seconds?
Make alert on create room text selectable. Change alert text so that the private is set as public-private
Make sure only to number of participants selected
Make it open to everyone?? (Upon being sent the validation of the room, see how many people in the room there are. If more than the max allowed, leave)
if last person leaves, should push data to server?
