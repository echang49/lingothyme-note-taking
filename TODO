IMPROVEMENTS
1. How socketio emits information. Currently emitting the entire paragraph but should emit specific characters and index
2. Move stuff to database semi-frequently? Like once every 30 seconds?
3. Create more paragraphs for each paragraph component (if do this, each paragraph component starts with 1 block)
4. Make alert on create room text selectable. Change alert text so that the private is set as public-private
6. Make sure only to number of participants selected
7. Add loading screen when loading site
8. Make responsive
9. if last person leaves, should push data to server?
10. Go back to home page after clicking ok to the alert
